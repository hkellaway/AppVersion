A Swift Î¼-Library for determining app version

## Getting Started

### Installation with CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'AppVersion', :git => 'https://github.com/hkellaway/AppVersion.git', :branch => 'trunk'
```

### Installation with Carthage

```
github "hkellaway/AppVersion"
```

## Usage

AppVersion is a simple little library that offers a structured type around typical app versioning. It currently supports the format of `major.minor.patch`, a subspecies of [Semver](https://semver.org/).

### Retrieving from Bundle

``` swift
let appVersion: AppVersion? = .fromBundle
```

### Creation from String

AppVersion can conveniently be created from strings:

``` swift
let appVersion: AppVersion? = "1.2.3"
```

### Comparison

Comparision operations (`==`, `>`, `<`, etc.) work seamlessly:

``` swift
let minimumAppVersion: AppVersion = "2.0.0"
guard AppVersion.fromBundle! >= minimumAppVersion else {
    // send user to App Store
}
```
