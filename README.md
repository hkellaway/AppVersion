AppVersion is a Swift Î¼-Library offering a structured type around iOS app versions that adhere to Semantic Versioning.

## Basic Usage

### Retrieving from Bundle

``` swift
let currentAppVersion: AppVersion? = .fromBundle
```

### Creation from String

An `AppVersion` can conveniently be created from a `String`:

``` swift
let appVersion: AppVersion = "1.2.3"
```

### Comparison

Comparison operations (`==`, `>`, `<`, etc.) work seamlessly:

``` swift
let minimumAppVersion: AppVersion = "2.0.0"
guard let currentAppVersion: AppVersion = .fromBundle, currentAppVersion >= minimumAppVersion else {
  // send user to App Store
}
```

## SemVer Utility

### Stability

``` swift
appVersion.isStable
appVersion.isPublic
appVersion.isPreRelease
```

### Next Version

To detemrine the next version:

``` swift
appVersion.nextMajor() // i.e. 1.2.3 goes to 2.0.0
appVersion.nextMinor() // i.e. 1.2.3 goes to 1.3.0
appVersion.nextPatch() // i.e. 1.2.3 goes to 1.2.4
```

### Prefixed with v

Versions prefixed with the common marker of `v` are accepted. i.e.:

``` swift
let validVersion: AppVersion = "v1.2.3"
```

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

See [Adding Package Dependencies to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app). Point to the desired version or the `trunk` branch.
